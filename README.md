# G1-Predicting-Energy-Consumption

# Project
A project of the Data Scientist professional certification with OpenClassRooms

# Data 
Sourced from: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy

# Objective 
Predicting the CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of non-residential buildings in Seatlle to reach the carbon neutral status by 2050

# Constraints
- Use 2  notebooks - exploratory and modeling

# Competencies
- Dataset preparation : Cleaning, Feature Engineering, EDA 
- EDA : Histograms, boxplots, heatmap, PCA, 
- Pre-processing : feature transfo (Polynomial, PCA), scaling (StandardSclaer, RobustScaler, QuantileTransformer), 
- Modeling : RandomForest, XGBRegressor, LinearRegression, SVR, ElasticNet, KNN
- Evaluation : RMSE, R2, Time
- Pipeline, GridSearchCV 

# Presentation Feedback from the Evaluator
- All the expectations are filed, complete, and meet the expectations of the project
- Good presentation, and explanation of the problem, its interpretation and the avenues of research envisaged.
- The learner explained very well the cleaning carried out, feature engineering and exploration.
- Categorical variables have been identified and transformed appropriately
- Several regression algorithms have been tried consistently, starting from the simplest to the most complex
- Several tailored metrics were chosen and used to evaluate performance
- Data was separated by train/test 
- The final choice of algorithm and hyperparameters are justified
- Excellent presentation, justification of choices
